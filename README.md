# Blong
Summary

Blong is a basic replica of the classic arcade game “Pong” that runs on iOS. This was my second project and it needed to track score, have an AI opponent to play against, and enable a “slingshot mode” that lets you start a round by flinging the ball “Angry Birds style” instead of it just starting by itself. The main skills I learned were UIKit Dynamics, UIViews, UIPanGestureRecognizer, and other associated general UI and UIKit APIs.

Explanation

After completing Bloc Notes, I began Blong. Blong could be made using Apple’s SpriteKit API, but this project was made specifically to teach the student UIKit Dynamics. So, most of the project was understanding the various things you can do with UIKit Dynamics, such as Gravity, Collision, Snap, Attachment, and Push behaviors.
